# Preloader-Animation
 Hi,
 today i created a preloder using css animations , transitions . You can make your own preloader or you can download a preloadar gif from internet . 

When the website content like (high quality images) is taking time for fully loading at that time the preloader will work and when the website is fully loaded in the browser then the preloader will automatically disappears .

You can learn more about preloaders on internet .

Here is my preloader that i created  - [Preloader](https://anjali-git-hub.github.io/Preloader-Animation/ "Preloader")
